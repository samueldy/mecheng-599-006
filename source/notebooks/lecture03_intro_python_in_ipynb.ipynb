    "Python is an *interpreted*, not compiled, language. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Benefit*: you can run your python scripts anywhere you install python, without the need to worry about getting code to compile correctly on different platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Drawback*: it is slower to run than a compiled language like C++ or FORTRAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Good news*: many libraries are available for python that are written in fast, compiled languages (they did that trouble for you). If you use them, you will save oodles of time both writing and running your scripts. Thus, we will be using them!\n",
    "\n",

This provides speed and flexibility, but also slows down running because variables are stored both with the value and type. More on this later. "
