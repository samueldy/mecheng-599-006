    "\n",
    "This course aims to create a new tributary in data science. Most engineering core curricula (aside from CS) do not include the following topics that are prereqs for DS and ML learning courses, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coding skills\n",
    "    - Example: at UMich, Matlab is taught to freshman, but many students do not continue to use it and thus do not become confident programmers. Additionally, Matlab is not generally used in industry. Python is widely used in academia and industry, and continues in grow in importance.\n",
    "    - Coding in python will be central to this course\n",
    "- Linear algebra\n",
    "    - We will not (cannot) go over all the material that would be taught in a pure linear algebra class\n",
    "    - We will focus on how computers use linear algebra to solve problems. We will include key terms and numerical implementation.\n",
    "- Probability and statistics\n",
    "    - The focus will not be theory but implementation and how they form the foundation for many DS techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not be able to cover all of the these topics in depth. I will introduce you to basics in each area that all of you should learn. I will point to resources for self-study that will likely be of great use to you, but you will not be responsible for knowing for this course."
